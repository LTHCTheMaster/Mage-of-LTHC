All player's mental health stats are reset to use the new mental health system

## What are new mental health levels?

before 1.5:

```md
- REALLY BAD
- BAD
- NEUTRAL
- GOOD
- REALLY GOOD
```

now in 1.5:

```md
- Hell
- Really Bad ++
- Really Bad +
- Really Bad
- Bad
- Neutral
- Good
- Really Good
- Really Good +
- Really Good ++
- Heaven

## A new progression curve for health levels !

The lower your sanity, the faster it will decrease. The higher your sanity, the slower it will increase.
